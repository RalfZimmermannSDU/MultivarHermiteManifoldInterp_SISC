# MultivarHermiteManifoldInterp_SISC
This folder contains code associated with with the paper "MULTIVARIATE HERMITE INTERPOLATION ON RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS" by Zimmermann/Bergmann

The code is published in order to ensure the reproducibility of the numerical experiments that feature in this paper.
It makes use of
* a simplistic implementation of the gradient enhanced Kriging method, see e.g.,
* an elementary Riemannian gradient descent with fixed step size for computing Riemannian barycenters

Both tasks can be tackled with more sophisticated implementations.
